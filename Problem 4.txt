Problem 4
Car Racing
A company is organising a car race to get publicity. They have sponsorships for n cars numbered 1 to n. There are m participants registered, and each has a preferred number. A participant will only drive a car if the care’s number is a factor of the driver’s preferred number.
Given a list of preferred numbers of the m participants and the number of cars n, determine the maximum number of participants in the race.
For example, there are m=4 participants whose preferences are prefNums=[1,3,6,8] and n=4 cars, numbered 1,2,3,4. The first driver takes car 1 because 1 is the only factor of 1. Car 3 can be driven by driver 2 because 3 is a factor if 3 (factors=1,3). The third driver chooses car 2 because 2 is a factor of 6 (factors=1,2,3,6). Finally, driver 4 chooses car 4 (factors=1,2,4,8). All four drivers can have a car.
Note: Factors of a number all of the divisors of that number with no remainder. For example, factors of 12 are [1,2,3,4,6,12].
Function Description
Complete the function maxParticipants in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the maximum number of participants in the race.
maxParticipants has the following parameters:
n: an integer that denotes the number of cars.
prefNums: an array of integers where the value of each element prefNums[i] is the preferred number of participant i (where 0<=i<=m).
Constraints
1<=n,m<=1000
1<=prefNums[i]<=1000
Sample case 0
n=3, prefNums=[5,2,1]
The first participants with preferred number 5 can only drive car number 1. The second participant with preferred number 2 can drive car number 1 and 2. The third participant with preferred number 1 can only drive car number 1. If car number 1 is driven by the first or third participant and car number 2 by the second, then the total number of participants is 2.
Sample Case 1
n=3, prefNums=[6,6,6]
The participants can select any of the cars because the factors of 6 are [1,2,3,6] and cars are numbered [1,2,3]. All 3 drivers can participate.
