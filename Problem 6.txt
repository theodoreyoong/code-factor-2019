Problem 6
The Cost of a Tree
Given an array of integers, construct a tree. Each node of the tree has either two children or none, in which case it is a leaf node. A leaf node costs 0 to construct. The cost to build a parent node is the product of the maximum leaf values in its left and right sub-trees. Partition the array to minimise the cost of building the entire tree.
For example, there are n=3 elements in the array [4,6,2]. There are two possible choices to split the array: {4}, {6,2} and {4,6}, {2}. Leaves are green, and parent nodes are blue.
Working through the first tree in the figure, the left sub-tree is 4 and the right sub-tree is {6,2}. The maxima are 4 and 6, so the root node costs 4x6=24 to create. Now, create leaves for {6,2} with their parent costing 6x2=12 to construct. The entire tree costs 24+12=36.
If the same analysis is performed on the second tree, the root node costs max({4,6})*2=12 to create, and the node below that on the left costs 4*6=24. Again, the cost is 36. If these two results were different, the minimum would be chosen. The answer is 36.
Function Description
Complete the function calculateCost in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the minimum cost to construct the tree.
calculateCost has the following parameter:
arr[arr[0],â€¦,arr[n-1]]: an array of integers.
Constraints
2<=n<=50
1<=arr[i]<=1000
Sample Case 0
arr=[1,2]
With just two nodes, there is only one choice for partitioning. The cost to build the root node, and hence entire binary tree, is 1x2=2.
Sample Case 1
arr=[5,3,1]
We have two ways to partition the nodes: {5}, {3,1}, and {5,3}, {1}. The respective trees are shown below.
The cost of the first tree is (5x3)+(3x1)=18, and the cost of the second tree is (5x1)+(5x3)=20. The minimum of the two costs is 18.
Sample Case 2
arr=[1,5,3]
We have two ways to partition the nodes: {1}, {5,3}, and {1,5}, {3}. The respective trees are shown below.
The cost of the first tree is (1x5)+(3x5)=20, and the cost of the second tree is (5x3)+(5x1)=20. Both scenarios produce a cost of 20.
